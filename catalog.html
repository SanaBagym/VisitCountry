                        <p>Although Japan is beautiful at any time of year, there is
        perhaps no better time to visit than during Cherry Blossom season,
        when the already exquisite landscapes and pretty city streets are
        further enhanced by papery pink blossoms otherwise known as
        Sakura.</p>
        <p>This stunning pink explosion is just as captivating to Japanese
        residents as it is to visitors. The ritual of Hanami - or 'flower
        viewing' - is an important part of Japanese culture during the
        spring, when people gather to enjoy each other's company and to
        appreciate the transient beauty of the spring blossoms. It can be
        as simple as a stroll in the park, but more often involves picnics
        with loved ones under the dazzling pinks of the trees overhead.</p>
